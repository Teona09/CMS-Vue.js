## CMS-Vue.js

### Frontend

Cerintele pentru platforma de CMS sunt exact aceleasi ca data trecuta:

- CRUD (create/read/update/delete) on a list of employees
- Employee properties: first name, last name, email, sex, birth date, profile picture
- Application must be fully responsive
- BONUS topics:

  - [ ] search (by name and email) - server/loccally
  - [ ] sortare (alfabetic dupa nume, dupa data nasterii) - server/loccally
  - [ ] filtrare (dupa sex, range pt data nasterii, has profile picture) - server/loccally

-

### Backend

You will need to implement:

A table of Employees containing all the required properties
All the required functions to move the data around

-

#### Keep in mind

- Donâ€™t forget about GIT
- You will not need to demo the backend
- You are free to use any version of VueJS and any libraries of your choosing
- I recommend you use axios to communicate with the backend
